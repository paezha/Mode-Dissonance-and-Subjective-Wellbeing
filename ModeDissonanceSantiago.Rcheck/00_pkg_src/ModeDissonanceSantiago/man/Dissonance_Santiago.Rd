  \item{TRAVEL_TIME}{Mode(s) that the respondent associates with feelings of efficiency}
  \item{WEIGHT_*}{A weight for the responses by affective or instrumental value.
  Some respondents selected more than one mode that they associated with feelings of
  {FREEDOM, ENJOYMENT, HAPPINESS, POVERTY, LUXURY, STATUS, SAFETY, TIME, and EFFICIENCY}.
  To avoid giving greater weight to respondents who indicated several modes of
  transportation, a weight was calculated that is the inverse of the number of
  modes indicated. These weights can be used to weight the frequencies prior to
  any analysis. For example WEIGHT_FREEDOM will be inversely proportional to the
  number of modes that a respondent named with respect to feelings of freedom}
