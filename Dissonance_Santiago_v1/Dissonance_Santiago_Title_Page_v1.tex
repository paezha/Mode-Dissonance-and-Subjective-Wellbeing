  \begin{abstract}
  \textbf{Introduction}\\
  Subjective wellbeing is a topic that has attracted considerable
  attention in recent years due to the way it correlates with health. From
  a transportation perspective, there is a burgeoning literature on the
  way travel can impact subjective wellbeing, and how this, in turn, can
  influence behavior.\\
  \textbf{Objective}\\
  The objective of this paper is to analyze a number of affective values
  associated with subjective wellbeing and the modes of transportation
  that people commonly use. In particular, we are interested in the
  potential for dissonance with respect to the primary mode of travel.\\
  \textbf{Materials and Methods}\\
  The study is based on data collected from a sample of travellers in the
  city of Santiago, in Chile. Participants in the study were asked about
  their usual mode of travel, and then were asked to name the mode or
  modes that they associate with the affective values of freedom,
  enjoyment, happiness, poverty, luxury and status. Analysis is based on
  tests of independence and visualization via mosaic plots.\\
  \textbf{Results}\\
  The results indicate that users of public transportation experience the
  most dissonance in terms of affective values, and active travellers the
  least. For those travellers who experience dissonance, active travel is
  the mode most commonly associated with freedom, enjoyment, and
  happiness, public transportation is most commonly associated with
  poverty, and the automobil is most commonly associated with luxury and
  status.
